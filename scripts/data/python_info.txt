Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It emphasizes code readability
with its notable use of significant indentation.

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and
functional programming. It has a comprehensive standard library and a large ecosystem of
third-party packages.

Common applications of Python include web development with frameworks like Django and Flask,
data analysis with libraries like pandas and NumPy, machine learning with scikit-learn and
TensorFlow, and automation scripting.

Python's syntax allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be
possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable
clear programs on both small and large scales.

Python interpreters are available for many operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows.
The language is dynamically typed and uses automatic memory management.
